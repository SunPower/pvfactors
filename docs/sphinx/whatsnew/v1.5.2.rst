v1.5.2 (DATE XX, 2021)
======================

Fixes
-----

* A small bug in the pvlib-python implementation of the Perez transposition model was
  discovered and fixed in pvlib v0.9.0.  To ensure the error does not affect pvfactors
  output moving forward, the pvlib dependency is updated from ``pvlib>=0.7.0,<0.9.0`` to
  ``pvlib>=0.9.0,<0.10.0``.  This will likely change the results of irradiance simulations.
  According to the
  [pvlib release notes](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/whatsnew.html#bug-fixes),
  the differences are "expected to be small and primarily occur at low irradiance conditions".
