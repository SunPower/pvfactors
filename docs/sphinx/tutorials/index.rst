Getting started: running simulations
====================================

Here is a quick overview on how to get started and run irradiance simulations with ``pvfactors``. The users may find it useful to first read the theory and mathematical formulation for :ref:`full_mode_theory` and :ref:`fast_mode_theory` to understand the difference between the two approaches.

Details on the "fast mode" simulations
======================================

In "fast mode" (and as described in the :ref:`fast_mode_theory` theory section), ``pvfactors`` assumes that all incident irradiance values for the system are known except for the PV row back surfaces. So since the system to solve is now explicit (no matrix inversion needed), vectorization is used to speed up the calculations.

This mode relies on "timeseries geometries" of the PV array, which are the attributes named ``ts_pvrows`` and ``ts_ground``, and which contain vectors of coordinates for all timestamps and for all geometry elements. Please take a look at the tutorial sections below for more details on the fast mode.

Details on the "full mode" simulations
======================================

In "full mode" (and as described in the :ref:`full_mode_theory` theory section), ``pvfactors`` calculates the equilibrium of reflections between all surfaces of the PV array for each timestamp. So the system to solve is implicit (matrix inversion required). This mode relies on timestamp specfic geometries for the PV array using its attributes ``pvrows`` and ``ground``.
