| pvfactors is an open-source irradiance modeling python package used by photovoltaic professionals to calculate incident irradiance on various surfaces of a PV array, including back side PV surfaces. pvfactors was originally ported from the SunPower developed vf_model package which was first presented at the IEEE PV Specialist Conference 44 ([#vf_paper]_, link_ to paper).
| You can find explanations on how to install the package in the :ref:`installation` section, and learn how to use it using both the :ref:`tutorials` and :ref:`developer_api` sections.
